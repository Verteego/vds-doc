The prediction module offers a simple and powerful way to produce predictive models without writing a line of code.

Supported algorithms are:

- Aggregator
- Deep Learning
- Distributed Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machine
- Generalized Linear Modeling
- Generalized Low Rank Modeling
- K-means
- Naive Bayes
- Principal Components Analysis

**Technology**

Verteego Data Science Suite's predictive technology is run on open source software H2O.

You may find the full documentation and tutorials `here <http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html>`_.

**Predictive models**

Models trained on H2O are packaged as `POJO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object>`_ (Plain Old Java Object) files that can easily be deployed and executed within the dataflow.
