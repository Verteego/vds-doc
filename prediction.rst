The prediction module offers a simple and powerful way to produce predictive models without writing a line of code.

Supported algorithms are:

- Aggregator
- Deep Learning
- Distributed Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machine
- Generalized Linear Modeling
- Generalized Low Rank Modeling
- K-means
- Naive Bayes
- Principal Components Analysis

**Technology**

Verteego Data Science Suite's predictive technology runs on open source software H2O.

You may find the full documentation and some tutorials `here <http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html>`_.

**Predictive modelling**

Models trained on H2O are packaged as Plain Old Java Objects (`POJO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object>`_) that can easily be deployed and executed within your dataflow.

Check out some `examples of production environments <http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/productionizing.html>`_.
